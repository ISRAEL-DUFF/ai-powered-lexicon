# LexiconGraphikos

LexiconGraphikos is an Ancient Greek Lexicon Generator. It allows users to enter any Ancient Greek word (in its lemma or inflected form) and receive a complete dictionary entry, written entirely in Ancient Greek.

This application leverages AI to perform lemma conversion and generate lexicographical data, including definitions, parts of speech, example sentences, and related terms.

## Features

-   **Lemma Conversion**: Converts inflected words to their dictionary form.
-   **AI-Powered Definitions**: Generates definitions, usage examples, and related words purely in Ancient Greek.
-   **Antique-Modern UI**: A user interface inspired by classical aesthetics, with a papyrus-like background and academic typography for an immersive experience.
